## Description

    The motivation for this project was to create a web page that that will fetch you an API of a weather server and display the weather information of the current time and also a forecast of the next 5 days of the city you need. I learn that for this work you needed to apply all the knowledge of all the past clases to be apply into this work even do I went above and used some different 3rd party API to better expand my knowledge with other cooding skils. 

## Usage
